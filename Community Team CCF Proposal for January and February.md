> **Option 1**: ✅ Yes, approve the budget of 32.14 bln QUBIC.

## 👥 What Is Community Management?
The Community Management Team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channels and supports several regional and multilingual hubs. Community Management acts as a stabilizing layer between protocol development, governance and community participants. It also brings support to other workgroups in the ecosystem. While the core team is composed of designated moderators and community support, it also relies on volunteers. Together they make up a team of more than 18 members.

**Their role include:**
<br/>🤝 Welcoming and onboarding new members
<br/>🛡️ Enforcing community rules
<br/>💬 Promoting constructive discussions
<br/>🎓 Providing internal training
<br/>🔧 Enhancing problem resolution among other workgroups

## 🔍 How We Used Past Funding during the last 2 months ## 
Due to market conditions and price fluctuations, the Community Team applied its dynamic compensation model to remain within the allocated budget. Despite these adjustments, operations on Discord and Telegram continued uninterrupted, with a full focus on core moderation, governance support, and community safety.

Additionally, with the support of the Administrators, we have redesigned the channel structure, improving navigability and better organizing discussions.

Funding during this period enabled the Community Management Team to maintain a safe, fair, and engaging environment across the Qubic ecosystem. This included continuous moderation, community engagement, policy enforcement, support for other workgroups, multilingual assistance and documentation across Discord and Telegram.

## 🌱 Community Growth
Over the past two months, community growth has continue with a slight contraction rather than expansion, largely reflecting broader market sentiment rather than platform-specific issues. On Telegram, this has manifested as a gradual decline of approximately 300 members driven by passive churn, with no sudden drops or structural problems observed. Given current conditions, expansion-focused initiatives have been intentionally deprioritized, as they are not critical at this stage. Despite this temporary retracement, the Telegram community remains structurally healthy and well positioned to regain momentum once market conditions improve and content distribution efforts are reactivated.

During the same period, Discord has continued to function as the primary coordination and discussion hub for the ecosystem. The server structure has been refined to better reflect ecosystem projects, with dedicated sections introduced and existing channels reorganized. This restructuring has significantly improved discussion quality by clearly separating general conversation, price-related topics, and ecosystem-specific discussions.
A similar structure has been applied to the Proposals and Community sections. With these changes, we aim to make relevant information clearer for newcomers and to favor a structure that can easily scale with future growth.

With a stable moderation framework and a well-defined server structure now in place, Discord is operationally prepared to accommodate renewed growth while preserving a constructive and organized community environment.

## 🏛️ Governance
In recent months, the governance structure based on the Community Quorum has been consolidating its importance.
We are encouraged by the growing use of the **#community-team** channel, where an increasing number of discussions and disagreements are being constructively resolved through open dialogue rather than escalation. Reflects a healthier communication culture and a stronger sense of shared responsibility within the ecosystem.

In parallel, work is underway to introduce a **new feedback structure** accessible outside of Discord and Telegram, allowing community members to submit structured feedback directly to the Community Management Team. This initiative, implemented thanks to the Core Tech team, aims to lower participation barriers, improve inclusivity and strengthen the feedback loop between governance, moderation and the wider community. Development of this structure is ongoing.

While the authority to define and amend rules remains with the Community Quorum, broader community participation is facilitated through polls that capture collective sentiment—particularly in sensitive or debated situations. Community Management plays a key execution role by translating governance outcomes into consistent moderation practices and clear communication across Discord and Telegram.


## 🧾 Budget breakdown
|CONCEPTS|JANUARY|VALUE IN $QUBIC|FEBRUARY|VALUE IN $QUBIC|TOTAL VALUE IN $QUBIC|
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|**Salaries**|$11250| 000 Billion $QUBIC|$11250|000 Billion $QUBIC| 000 Billion $QUBIC|
|**TOTAL**|$11250| 000 Billion $QUBIC|$11250|000 Billion $QUBIC| 000 Billion $QUBIC|

**Salaries cover full-time and part-time moderators based on workload, responsibility with the dynamic salary model described below.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We apply a **dynamic salary model** based on price tiers. A 3-level salary system, subject to modifications, adjusts compensation based on Qubic price. If the price drops below set thresholds, salaries are reduced accordingly. If the price rises again, salaries are restored to higher levels. This model aligns compensation with market performance. It helps manage budget during downturns and rewards during growth. This model has already been applied in practice and allows the Community Team to remain operational without requiring emergency budget revisions.
<br/><br/>Monthly salary expenses have been reduced from **$16K** to **$11K**, representing an approximate **30% reduction** in response to current PA conditions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *We have been hosting consistent weekly fun activities for the community for more than a year. The server has approximately ~60,000 members, with ~0.03–0.17% active participation of the total server size. Activities include/included weekly game nights, quiz nights, and occasional activities based on major events around the project. Activities have been paused as well as the allocated budget. <br/>(Amount spent in last 3 months $1080 worth of $QUBIC)
<br/><br/>The community team will be taking a break from hosting activities to get a new refresh. There were some malicious practices detected from a group of people aiming only to extract and not providing value in any of the other aspects of the project. We highly value true support and engagement so this pause will help us in filtering. We plan to continue these later this year and even open to new ideas and type of activities
