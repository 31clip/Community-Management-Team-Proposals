## What Is Community Management
The Community Management Team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channels and supports several regional and multilingual hubs. While the core team is composed of designated moderators and coordinators, it also relies on volunteers. Together they make up a team of approximately 18 members.
Their role includes:
* Welcoming and onboarding new members

* Enforcing community rules

* Promoting constructive discussions

* Organizing interactive events and quizzes with small incentives

* Managing reports and disputes

* This proposal aims to fund the basic operations and recognize the expanded responsibilities and professionalization of the team.
